This application has been created as a course project of the Developing Data Products course by Coursera.

It uses the default "mtcars" dataset installed with R.  The data is from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises fuel consumption and ten characteristics of automobile design and performance for 32 cars.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
