This application is created as a course project of the Coursera - Developing Data Products course.

### Dataset
It uses the default "mtcars" dataset installed with R.  The data is from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises fuel consumption and ten characteristics of automobile design and performance for 32 cars (1973-74 models).

### Application description
This Shiny application displays the fuel consumption based on the transmission type, cylinders and horse power variables.

### Usage
Usage:

1. Change the input data value of cylinders, transmission type and/or horse power.
2. Summary measures for miles/gallon should reflect the change accordingly.

### Presentation Pitch
Required presentation pitch done in RStudio Presenter is published on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/kmj9000/DDP).

### Source codes
